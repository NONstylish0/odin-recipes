 One soda I’ll always order off the menu is a crisp Coke over ice. While there have been many new variations of the beverage—from Cherry Coke and Vanilla to Orange Cream and Cherry Float, the original flavor will always be my go-to.

Now, the brand is offering a notable formula switch for the first time in nearly 40 years—and it has sparked some serious chatter among fans online.  </pre
