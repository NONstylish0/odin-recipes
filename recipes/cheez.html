    <p>
      Every family has their food traditions, and I'm not talking about the
      standard ones like turkey on Thanksgiving or hot dogs on the Fourth of
      July. I'm talking about the esoteric dishes—the chili your family has to
      eat on Halloween before trick or treating, or the special chocolate cake
      you make every year for a wedding anniversary. Sometimes these traditions
      are handed down to us from our parents, and other times we create them
      ourselves.
